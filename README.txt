========================

Urban games are nowadays a very popular phenomena in a field of social events. They are becoming bigger and bigger in scale, attracting large groups of new players. Together with Patronage participants we would like to create a common framework, that would facilitate performing them. Mobile application, giving unique flexibility and new, inspiring possibilities, supported by a server, allowing results tracking, will altogether bring fresh quality to location-based gaming. We strongly believe that program participants, being guided and mentored by our specialists, benefiting from their experience and knowledge and using cutting-edge technologies will take the opportunity to stun modern urban gaming community!

		com.blstream.urbangame
		-v
		-f
		-m
		-S DEV_HOME/res
		-J DEV_HOME/src
		-M DEV_HOME/AndroidManifest.xml
		-I ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-17/android.jar
	
2. Compile code
	javac
		-verbose
		-d DEV_HOME/bin
		-classpath ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-17/android.jar;DEV_HOME/bin
		-sourcepath DEV_HOME/src
		DEV_HOME/src/com/blstream/*.java

3. Create DEX file
	dx
		--dex
		--verbose
		--output=DEV_HOME/bin/classes.dex

		com.blstream.urbangame
		-v
		-f
		-M DEV_HOME/AndroidManifest.xml
		-S DEV_HOME/res
		-I ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-17/android.jar

		-storepass password
		-keypass password
		-signedjar 	DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug-unaligned.apk
					DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug-unsigned.apk
		UrbanGame

7. Zip-align APK file
	zipalign
		-v
		-f
		4
		DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug-unaligned.apk
		DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug.apk
		
# RUN ANDROID APPLICATION

1. Create Emulator (AVD)
	android
		--verbose
		create avd
		--name UrbanGameEmulator
		--target android-17
		--sdcard 1024M

2. Run AVD
	emulator
		-wipe-data
		-avd UrbanGameEmulator
	
3a. Install in emulator
	adb
		-e
		install DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug.apk

To run application on a deveice just enable USB debugging there.

3b. Install on device
	adb
		-d
		install DEV_HOME/bin/UrbanGame-debug.apk
		
# 3rd solution # BUILD ANDROID APP FROM ECLIPSE IDE

1. Download Eclipse for Mobile Developers from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-mobile-developers/junosr2
